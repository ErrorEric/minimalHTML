To add an ID, add a comment to your HTML code before the text or path name that is going to be able to be changed by the program.

The comment should look like this :


<!-- MHI_text_>_<_ -->


<!-- : open a comment

MHI_ : keyword (Minimalistic Html Id)

text_ : name of your ID + _

>_ : string that opens the text to register + _

<_ : string that closes the text to register + _

--> : close a comment

example code snippet :

<p>Lorem ipsum</p>
<!-- MHI_MainText_p>_</p_ -->  <p>This is the text that can be changed by the program</p> 
<p> Lorem ipsum

_______

This code would generate an ID named MainText that changed the text in the middle.
